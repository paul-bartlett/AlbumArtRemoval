Album Art Removal
=================
Removes unnecessary album art files that occur from ripping cd's with various programs. Runs recursively on all subfolders of the chosen folder. If the folder structure is setup as Artist -> Album -> Songs, then any image name with the artist or album in it will be kept. Also ignores cover.* and folder.*. Works with PowerShell 3.0+.
