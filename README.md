Album Art Removal
=================
Removes unnecessary album art files that occur from ripping cd's with various programs, specifically low quality hidden images created from Windows Media Player. Allows user to choose navigate to music folder and then runs recursively on all subfolders of the chosen folder. If the folder structure is setup as Artist -> Album -> Songs, then any image name with the artist or album in it will be kept. Also ignores cover.* and folder.*. Works with PowerShell 3.0+ and includes statement for 2.0.
